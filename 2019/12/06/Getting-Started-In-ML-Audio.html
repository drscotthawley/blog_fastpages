<p>Recently, after co-chairing the session on Machine Learning for Musical Acoustics along with the wonderful <a href="http://audioakustyka.org/head-of-laboratory/">Bozena Kostek</a> at the <a href="https://acousticalsociety.org/program-of-178th-meeting-of-the-acoustical-society-of-america/">Acoustical Society of America Meeting in San Diego</a>, a student came up to me to ask for advice or resources on how to start learning machine learning for audio applications.</p>

<p>And I didn’t have a good answer.  Because, while there’s plenty of tips out there for learning image classification or NLP, not a ton of it relates to audio.  Students have asked me this before…and so I was frustrated by my own lack of an answer, apart from “read whatever you find, try out demos, take whatever courses you can, etc.”</p>

<p>SO!  Now, with graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-miller-1aa8355a/">Ryan Miller</a>  (EDIT 6/1/2020: who is now gainfully employed at Creative Labs!), we compiled a list and posted it to GitHub:</p>

<p>… and soliciting contributions from the community.</p>

<p>EDIT 02/01/2020: We now have contributions from accomplished researchers at Google, Adobe, and others!</p>
